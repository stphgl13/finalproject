<p>Carbon is a fundamental element that forms the backbone of all organic molecules, making it essential for life on Earth. Plants and animals interact with carbon differently: plants absorb carbon dioxide and use it to grow and store carbon in their tissues, while animals obtain carbon by consuming plants or other animals. When Toomey refers to "one of the key balancing acts of life on Earth," he is highlighting the delicate balance of the carbon that is absorbed by organisms and the carbon released into the atmosphere. Carbon fuels cause excess carbon to be released into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. This is worrisome because the excess carbon disrupts the carbon cycle, leading to environmental instability. A Lot of carbon is also absorbed by the oceans, meaning we face major impacts to marine life as a result. Marine plants like seagrasses play a key role in this process, and industries like oil and gas extraction threaten these plants and the ecosystems that rely on them.The destruction of the plants are also critical for the environment, as the carbon they absorb is released back into the atmosphere. About 44% of the planetâ€™s inhabitants live near a coastline or rely on marine life, and the destruction of marine plants will have adverse effects that will be felt by these communities. The impact to biodiversity, carbon storage, and coastal protection is palpable as a result of carbon emissions.
