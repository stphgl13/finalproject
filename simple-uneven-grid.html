                <p>A cow was seen in the back of a four door buick at a local Mcdonalds drive-thru yesterday.</p>
                <p> “I thought it was fake at first,” said Jessica Nelson, a witness to the event. “Who puts a cow in a Buick? Then its whole head moved.”</p>
                <p> The car containing cows was in front of her in the drive-thru line. Nelson captured the cow in the backseat on video, and uploaded the footage in a post online.</p>
                 <p>“There’s a whole ass cow in the back of that car!!!” Nelson wrote on the post.</p>
                 <p>The owners noticed her interest and explained to her that the car actually contained three total cows, recently purchased from an auction. 
                 The owners became hungry after their recent purchase, and decided on burgers, which brought them to the drive-thru.
