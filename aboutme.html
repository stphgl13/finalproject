                <p>I worked sales for a few years, but never once managed to hit a single sales related goal. I was never fired, but it seemed I was kept around for my ability to solve issues, or willingness to do the most 'out-of-my-job-role' tasks. Eventually, I stepped away from sales and into a role where it's my job to solve issues. </p>
                <p> All that to sayâ€” I couldn't pitch something and sell it to you, even if you paid me to. That unfortunately includes myself.
                </p>
                <p> However, if you like problem solving, overbearing commitment, life-ruining perfectionism, and brutal honesty... I'm your gal! I also look great as a diversity hire, but for legal reasons you will have to assume by which metric. 
                </p>
                 <p>Survived by 3 cats, a dog, and a dwindling sense of community with others.
